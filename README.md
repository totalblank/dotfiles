# My Arch Linux dotfiles.

**NOTE**

This repo is tailored towards my wants and needs. Go through all the files before
using anything.

`Xorg` with `dwm` forever. I believe in no patches and
keeping things minimal. But I found a cool wallpaper from
some corner of Reddit.

`working` is the main branch. Somehow, I messed up `master`.

# Usage

Clone the repo in `$HOME` and run the `init.sh` shell script.
