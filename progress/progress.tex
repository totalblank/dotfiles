\subsection*{Targets}
\noindent Already it is 18th of June and I haven't made any significant progress so far. But
I have put in some hours. I wish to solve the following issues this month,

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
  \item My stamina is all time low. To combad this \emph{3 sets of burpees, 3 sets of push ups per day}.
  \item I wish to take the GRE within 15th July to 20th July. To finalize my prep, I need to study for
        at least 150 hours, from which I have only completed \juneGRE hours. I MUST complete one hundred
        hours this month. That leaves me with \fpeval{100 - \juneGRE} hours more in this month, which is
        \fpeval{(100 - \juneGRE) / 13} hours per day. So, the target is 6 hours per day, only for GRE.
  \item I need to build my programming portfolio. 10 hours per day on these.
  \item Don't eat like a cow. Only three meals a day, make sure to eat plenty of protein.
\end{itemize}

\noindent If I deem that my preparation is good enough for GRE, I am going to spend less time on GRE.

\subsection*{Completed so far}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
  \item GRE           - \juneGRE hours
  \item CP \& DSA     - \juneDSACP hours
  \item Python        - \junePYTHON hours
  \item Data Science  - \juneDS hours
  \item Research      - \juneRESEARCH hours
\end{itemize}

\noindent Total is \juneTOTAL{} hours.

\noindent I will not lose myself to myself. I prevail over anything and everything.
